Facility Layout Swarm
=====================
I wrote this program in college as an industrial engineering student under the 
guidance of a former computer engineering professor. It uses swarm intelligence
techniques to efficiently place the departments of a facility by minimizing the
cost to move material between the departments.

This code base predates my knowledge of software best practices. It mixes UI 
code with business logic, uses no object-oriented techniques, and litters magic 
strings and numbers everywhere. It also led me to choose programming as a 
profession, and I love it dearly. 

Five years into my career, I want to see if I can do this program justice. I 
intend to port the code from VB.NET to C#, from a procedural mess to a clean, 
well-tested, object-oriented architecture, and from Windows Forms to WPF for 
a worthy visualization of the algorithm.
